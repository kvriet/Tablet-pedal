#Print instructions

Print in layer height 0.28 or 0.3mm. Use the print orientation as supplied in the STLs. There's no need for supports, but using a brim for the page turner top and axle washers is a good idea to prevent the prints from warping or coming off the printbed.

The washers might be too loose or tight on your printer. Try scaling the washers up or down a little to make them screw onto the bolts nicely.
